But here, my service and road coverage has all been well explained - and let up to me to decide. \\nAnd they just renovated the waiting room. It looks a lot better than it did in previous years.  \n",

I also went in this week for them to fix a minor problem with a tire they put on. They \\\"fixed\\\" it for free, and the very next morning I had the same issue. I called to complain, and the \\\"manager\\\" didn't even apologize!!! So frustrated. Never going back.  They seem overpriced, too.  \n",

Unfortunately the service is very hit or miss. The main issue seems to be with the kitchen, the waiters and waitresses are often very apologetic for the long waits and it's pretty obvious that some of them avoid the tables after taking the initial order to avoid hearing complaints.  \n",

I always find something (usually I find 3-4 things and spend about $60) and better still, I am always still wearing the clothes and shoes 3 months later. \\n\\nI kind of suspect this is the best shopping in Pittsburgh; it's much better than the usual department stores, better than Marshall's and TJ Maxx and better than the Saks downtown, even when it has a sale. Selection, bargains AND quality.\\n\\nI like this Filene's better than Gabriel Brothers, which are harder to get to. Gabriel Brothers are a real discount shopper's challenge and I'm afraid I didn't live in Pittsburgh long enough to develop the necessary skills . . . Filene's was still up and running in June 2007 when I left town.  \n",

       "37996                          Items Selected:\\nChocolate Cinnamon Horn\\nSmall Cinnamon Crunch Cronut\\nBlueberry Fritter\\nBlueberry Frosted Cake\\nApple Cinnamon Bear Claw\\nCinnamon Crunch Hole, Glazed Hole, Powdered Sugar Hole\\n\\nA new year and a new favorite, the second of back-to-back weeks at Ace Donuts again showed the high quality of the new bakery's goods and this time opting for items not available on my first visit it was a truly excellent quintet that kicked of 2015 - the soft ring beneath blueberry frosting eating more like butter-cake than a doughnut while the fritter and cronut again shined despite selecting smaller versions and different constituents.  More than enough to share, but so good that one may not want to, it was largely due to my early hour of arrival that the Jumbo Bear Claw stuffed with ample amounts of cinnamon apples outshined any similar pastry in the city and although the combination of rich chocolate and substantial notes of cinnamon may not appeal to every palate the crispy exterior and soft insides of the gnarly horn was a veritable cornucopia of flavor, the warm delivery making the aromatics even more impactful and the chocolate just messy enough to justify the use of a fork and knife.\\n\\nUndoubtedly the best all-around doughnuttery in Las Vegas - Artisan, Old School, or Otherwise.  \n",

       "37999  I have been using this company for 11 months.  Ryan would come out every other week and do what he needed to be done. Very little was required as I have desert landscaping and pretty much maintained it myself.  Just needed blowing and general light cleanup.  Ryan was very thorough.\\nThen his brother, I believe, would  come out.  I would have to watch him as if I was not looking, it would be a pretty much \\\"hit and run\\\" literally.\\nI was expecting them Friday.  No show, no call as they never call when they cannot make it.  I have to call them and ask where they are or if they are coming.   Finally a text back saying they will be there Monday as they are running late.\\n\\nMonday comes and again no call no show.  I texted them...no answer...I was very upset at this point as I asked if they would trim a tree that is coming into my yard from a neighbor.  Mind you, there is very little to do here...no grass...no weeds..no plants to constantly trim.  I felt that I asked them to trim a tree and they could not be bothered.\\n\\nI am extremely disappointed in this company as they start out fine and as it continues, they seem to take their customer's for granted.  NO COMMUNICATION...NOT EVEN A CALL WHEN THEY CANNOT COME.   \\n\\nSORRY RYAN, I WILL TAKE MY BUSINESS ELSEWHERE.  AS A BUSINESS OWNER, YOU SHOULD KNOW BETTER!!!!  \n",
